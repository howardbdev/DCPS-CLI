This is a CLI program used to retrieve information about schools and principals from the website for the DC Public School system.  If you have any questions or comments, I am available through github as lhwall.  Thank you for your interest in this program.

To use this program, start the config/run file.  It takes a little while to start because it has to scrape a number of pages and instantiate so many objects so please be patient.

Special thanks to my husband Robert for helping me test this program by entering as many dumb things as possible to try to break it.
