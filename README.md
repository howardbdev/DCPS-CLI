DCPSCLI will be a command-line app that lets a user view information about DC public schools with information pulled from the website http://profiles.dcps.dc.gov/.  When they run the app, they will see a list of options including viewing all schools, viewing all principals in alphabetical order by school, viewing all principals in alphabetical order by last name, viewing all principals with email addresses, finding a principal by name or grade, and finding schools by name or grade.  If they select a school or principal they will be able to view additional details such as email addresses and

I will have a school class for each school with attributes including principal, address, grade levels, and the page for their DCPS profile and a principal class including schools, first and last names, and email addresses.  I will also need a scraper to pull the information from the website and of course the CLI itself so people can actually view the information.
